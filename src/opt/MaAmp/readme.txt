Maemo Ampache player (MaAmp) 0.0.3 - (early test-version).
 * by nesnomis <nesnomis@gmail.com>

This is a little mediaplayer for those with an Ampache server.
It is mainly a little project for learning some Python,Qt and more.. :) 

Inspired and helped by inspecting: 
 * A lot of maemo python projects
 * Viridian Ampache project
 * And the quickplay.py project.

Plans for the future:
 * MAFW Backend?!
 * Playlists?!
 * Download album/song?!
 * Bugfixing and cleaning!... :)

For suggestions, ideas, collaboration e.t.c. mail me! (see mail above).
