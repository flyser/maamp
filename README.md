MaAmp is an Ampache media player for Maemo 5 (Nokia N900).

It was [originally developed by Neil Simonsen](http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=65625), who abadoned the project.
The reason for this fork is to fix the problems I was having when using
MaAmp with my ownCloud Ampache server, but it might also serve the
purpose of continuing the development.
as always: **pull requests are very welcome!**

If enough people care about this, I will try to push it into extras-devel.

Please report bugs on <https://github.com/flyser/maamp/issues>.
